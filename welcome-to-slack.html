<p>Slack is a great way for the community to stay in touch, in this page we included some information
that will make your slack experience better.</p>
<p>First of all, we have a <a href="http://techqueria.org/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>, in short, this is a
profesional community, be respectful of everyone and their identity.
Non profesional behavior is not accepted. If you feel that someone is breaking
the code of conduct <a href="http://techqueria.org/contact/">contact us</a> and we will sort it out.</p>
<p>If this is your first time using slack  and want to learn more about it, start
<a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users">here</a>.</p>
<p>We have customized a few things about our slack to make communications better, we have bots, custom emoji,
special commands and channels to make communication better.</p>
<h1 id="public-channels">Public Channels</h1>
<p>We have created different channels to keep conversations relevant. Those channels are not joined by deault, you can
click on <em>CHANNELS</em> to see a list of all the channels and join the ones you want.</p>
<h2 id="default-channels">Default Channels</h2>
<p>There are three default channels:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#admin-announcements</code> is locked to the organizers, is where we
  post news and information about the community and future events.</li>
<li><code>#jobs</code> is for sharing and requesting job opportunities.</li>
<li><code>#random</code> is used for conversations that don't particularly fit in any topic channel,
  but could be relevant for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>We monitor most activity in those channels to make sure content is relevant, if something
off-topic is posted there, we might move it to a more appropiate channel.</p>
<h2 id="location-channels">Location Channels</h2>
<p>We have a few location channels, they're prefixed with <code>locals</code>, like: <code>#locals-sf</code>, <code>#locals-chicago</code>, <code>#locals-nyc</code>, <code>#locals-la</code>, <code>#locals-sandiego</code>,
and you can contact the admins to get new ones started.</p>
<p>Use them to communicate with folks in those locations, whether you
live there or visiting it can be a great resource.</p>
<h2 id="topic-channels">Topic channels</h2>
<p>We have some great conversations about <code>#comida</code>, <code>#musica</code>, <code>#futbol</code>,
<code>#politica</code>, <code>#memes</code>, <code>#mentoring</code> and other topics in their respective channels.</p>
<h1 id="private-channels">Private channels</h1>
<p>We have a few private channels for conversations that you don't want everyone to see,
we're using a system created by <a href="http://wealljs.org">WeAllJs</a> to
manage the participation in those.</p>
<p>To see a list of available channels, run the command <code>/list-private</code>,
and click on the join button to request an invitation.</p>
<p><img src="/images/slack-command-list.png" alt="alt tag"></p>
<h1 id="emojis">Emojis</h1>
<p>When you click on the emoji icon in the conversation or to add a reaction,
you can see a ton of custom ones we've added.
You can find images for things like arepa, empanada, baseball teams,
avocado, etc. Take a look at them and enjoy! and
